    "# Lecture 01: Logistic Regression\n",

    "In the previous lecture we saw how to learn a *regression* model. Regression problems involve predicting a continuous valued variable with range $-\\infty, \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of problem is called *classification*. *Binary* classification is the simplest kind of classification problem. Binary classification problems have YES or NO answers. For instance, \"Is this a photo of a cat?\" \"Will this patient die in the next 3 months?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification problems can have more than one *class*. For instance, the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) is a dataset of 70,000 images of handwritten numerals: 0 through 9. Each image belongs to one of *ten* classes: it is either a zero, or a one, or a two, et cetera.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could *try* to cast classification as a regression. For instance, we could try to use a linear regression model, and try to train it so that if the image is a 9, the linear model outputs 9.0. That will work very poorly though.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem is this. What does it mean if your linear regression model -7? Or 33? Or 3.75? Do you round to the closest class? But then every negative number maps to class 0, whereas only the range $(4.5, 5.5)$ maps to class 5. That certainly seems unfair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also: let's say for an example $x$ your linear model outputs 3.5, but the correct class is $y = 5$. You would like to increase the output of your linear model, so that it is closer to guessing the right answer. But by increasing the output, you are also making the model think that the answers $y = 4$ and $y = 6$ are more \"likely,\" too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is this: you're putting the classes on a one-dimensional continuum, when in fact they are discrete. There is no way to slowly change a 0 digit into a 1, and then keep changing like that from a 1 to a 2. That's fundamentally why trying to cast this problem as regression is so wrong.\n"
